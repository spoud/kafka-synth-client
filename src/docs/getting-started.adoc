== Getting started

=== Using docker-compose

Use the docker compose file found at the root of this repository.

Start everything using

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a kafka broker, the kafka-synth-client and prometheus so you can store visualize the metrics. Prometheus will be available at `http://localhost:9090`. You can try the following queries:
```promql
synth_client_e2e_latency_ms
```

If you want to test against your own kafka cluster, be sure to change the kafka parameters in the docker-compose file. Everything prefixed with `KAFKA_` will be used in the kafka client.

Refer to the chapter <<Parameters>> for more information on the available parameters.
