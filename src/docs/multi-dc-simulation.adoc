== Multi DC simulation

We have created a docker-compose file that simulates a multi-DC Kafka cluster with 3 DCs.

Ensure you have built the image with maven.

Startup:

[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose -f multi-dc-docker-compose.yaml up -d
----

Dashboard can be found at `http://localhost:3000` with username `admin` and password `admin`.
Prometheus can be found at `http://localhost:9090`.
There are 2 sets of synth clients deployed one reading and writing to a not replicated topic `...ackone` and one to a fully replicated topic `...ackall`.

Introduce latency on the network in DC2 (requires pumba to be installed https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba):

[source,shell script]
----
pumba netem --tc-image ghcr.io/alexei-led/pumba-alpine-nettools:latest \
    --duration 5m \
    delay --time 1000 \
    --jitter 100 \
    redpanda-2

# you may want to enter another broker and test the delay with pings
docker exec -u 0 -ti redpanda-1 bash
apt update; apt install -y iputils-ping
ping redpanda-2

----

Tear down:

[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose -f multi-dc-docker-compose.yaml down -v
----
