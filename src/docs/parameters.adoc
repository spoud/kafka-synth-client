You have the possibility to tweak the configuration using environment variables. Below is an overview of some key configuration parameters.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_TOPIC`
| _<mandatory>_
| The Kafka topic to produce to and consume from.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_MESSAGES_MESSAGE_SIZE_BYTES`
| 8
| The size of each Kafka message in bytes.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_MESSAGES_MESSAGES_PER_SECOND`
| 1
| The number of messages to produce per second.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_RACK`
| <empty string>
| Some identifier of the environment in which the client is running. For example "eu-west-1a". This is useful for measuring latencies between clients that are running in different environments. Can be left unset if not needed.

Furthermore, any environment variable prefixed with `KAFKA_` will be interpreted as a Kafka Producer/Consumer configuration property.
For example, setting `KAFKA_GROUP_ID` will set the value of the `group.id` consumer property.
