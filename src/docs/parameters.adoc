== Parameters

The preferred way to configure the client is to use environment variables. Below is an overview of some key configuration parameters.

|===
|Parameter | default | Description

| `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`
| _<mandatory>_
| Kafka bootstrap servers

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_TOPIC`
| _<mandatory>_
| The Kafka topic to produce to and consume from.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_CONSUMER_TOPIC_REGEX`
| a regex pattern that matches only the value of `SYNTH_CLIENT_TOPIC`
| A regex pattern describing which topics to consume from. This is only needed if the topics you want to consume from differ from the topic you produce to.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_RACK`
| "default"
| Some identifier of the environment in which the client is running. For example "eu-west-1a". This is useful for measuring latencies between clients that are running in different environments. Can be left unset if not needed. If you have multiple racks, then be sure to assign a unique consumer group ID to each rack.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_MESSAGES_MESSAGE_SIZE_BYTES`
| 8
| The size of each Kafka message in bytes.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_MESSAGES_MESSAGES_PER_SECOND`
| 10
| The number of messages to produce per second.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_MESSAGES_IGNORE_FIRST_N_MESSAGES`
| 10
| The number of messages (per partition) to ignore before starting to measure latencies. This is useful for avoiding adding noise to the metrics when the consumer group is being rebalanced. The default value should be sufficient.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_SAMPLING_TIME_WINDOW`
| 2m
| Duration length of the time window for which to calculate the latencies. The default value should be sufficient.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_MIN_SAMPLES_FIRST_WINDOW`
| 100
| Number of samples before percentiles are calculated. The default value should be sufficient.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_AUTO_CREATE_TOPIC`
| true
| If the topic is managed by the synth client and also created by the synth client. This requires `CREATE` permissions.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_TIME_SERVERS`
| time.google.com
| NTP server to use for time synchronization.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR`
| 1
| Replication factor to use when creating the topic.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_PUBLISH_HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS`
| false
| Will publish the histogram buckets to the metrics endpoint if enabled. `..., synth_client_e2e_latency_ms_bucket{...,le="41.0",} 902.0, synth_client_e2e_latency_ms_bucket{...,le="46.0",} 902.0, ...`

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_EXPECTED_MIN_LATENCY`
| 1.0
| Minimum expected latency in milliseconds. Used to create histogram buckets when enabled.

| `SYNTH_CLIENT_EXPECTED_MAX_LATENCY`
| 1.0
| Maximum expected latency in milliseconds. Used to create histogram buckets when enabled.

| `QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT`
| 8081
| The port on which the metrics endpoint will be exposed.

| `QUARKUS_LOG_LEVEL`
| INFO
| Set to `DEBUG` to get more insights.

| `QUARKUS_LOG_CONSOLE_JSON_ENABLED`
| false
| Set to `true` to enable json logging.

| `QUARKUS_LOG_CONSOLE_JSON_LOG_FORMAT`
| default
| Set to `ecs` for elastic common schema.

| `JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO`
| 50
| This is used to calculate the default maximal heap memory based on a container's restriction. If used in a container without any memory constraints for the container then this option has no effect. The default is `50` which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper boundary.
|===

Furthermore, any environment variable prefixed with `KAFKA_` will be interpreted as a Kafka Producer/Consumer configuration property.
For example, setting `KAFKA_GROUP_ID` will set the value of the `group.id` consumer property.

`KAFKA_CONFIG_PROVIDERS` are supported like `file` or `env`. For example, setting `KAFKA_CONFIG_PROVIDERS=file` will load the configuration from a file.
`KAFKA_CONFIG_PROVIDERS_FILE_CLASS` will be used to define the provider class. For example, setting `KAFKA_CONFIG_PROVIDERS_FILE_CLASS=org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.FileConfigProvider` will load the configuration from a file.

Be aware that e.g. `${file:/path/to/file}` needs to be escaped in the environment variable. For example, `KAFKA_CONFIG_PROVIDERS_FILE_PATH=\${file:/path/to/file}` otherwise quarkus will try to resolve it as variable and you will see `Error injecting java.util.Map<java.lang.String, java.lang.String> io.spoud.kafka.KafkaFactory.config`.

Use the following rule to convert a config property name to an environment variable name:
- Replace all dots (`.`) with underscores (`_`)
- Convert to uppercase
- Prefix with `KAFKA_`

For example, the Kafka property `bootstrap.servers` would be set as the environment variable `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`.

For a list of Kafka configuration options, see the following links:

- https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/consumer-configs.html[Kafka Consumer Configuration]

Note that key/value serializers and deserializers are already configured and must not be overridden.

When deploying a synth-client instance, be sure that it is not completely utilizing the CPU.
If the CPU is fully utilized, then the client will not be able to consume messages in a timely manner, which will result in skewed latencies.
